## bin_choose

__bin_choose()__ calculates the number of combinations in which k successes can occur in n trials.

The number of combinations “n choose k” is given by:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
$$

```{r}
bin_choose(n = 5, k = 2)
bin_choose(5, 0) 
bin_choose(5, 1:3)
```


## bin_probability

Use __bin_choose()__ to create a main function __bin_probability()__, which takes three arguments: __success__, __trials__, and __prob__, calculating the probability of getting designated number of successes in designated number of trials.  

Trials less than 0, success exceeding trials or prob not between 0 and 1 raises an error. So do the following functions.

```{r}
# probability of getting 2 successes in 5 trials
# (assuming prob of success = 0.5)
bin_probability(success = 2, trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```

```{r}
# probabilities of getting 2 or less successes in 5 trials 
# (assuming prob of success = 0.5)
bin_probability(success = 0:2, trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```

```{r}
# 55 heads in 100 tosses of a loaded coin with 45% chance of heads
bin_probability(success = 55, trials = 100, prob = 0.45)
```


## bin_distribution

Use __bin_probability()__ to create a main function __bin_distribution()__, which takes two arguments: __trials__, and __prob__, returning a __data.frame__ with two classes: __c("bindis", "data.frame")__ and the probability distribution: _sucesses_ in the first column, _probability_ in the second column.

```{r}
# binomial probability distribution
bin_distribution(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```

And there's a plotting method (i.e. a function) that graphs a barplot to display the probability histogram of a binomial distribution object "bindis".

```{r}
# plotting binomial probability distribution
dis1 <- bin_distribution(trials = 5, prob = 0.5) 
plot(dis1)
```


## bin_cumulative

Use __bin_distribution()__ to create a main function __bin_cumulative()__, which takes two arguments: __trials__, and __prob__, returning a __data.frame__ with two classes: __c("bindis", "data.frame")__ and both the probability distribution and the cumulative probabilities: _sucesses_ in the first column, _probability_ in the second column and and _cumulative_ in the third column.

```{r}
# binomial cumulative distribution
bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```

```{r}
# plotting binomial cumulative distribution
dis2 <- bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
plot(dis2)
```


## bin_variable

Taking two arguments: __trials__ and __prob__, the function __bin_variable__ returns an object of class "binvar", which means a _binomial random variable_ object.

And we define the print, summary and print summary ways of this binvar object.

```{r}
bin1 <- bin_variable(trials = 10, p = 0.3) 
bin1
```

```{r}
bin1 <- bin_variable(trials = 10, p = 0.3)
binsum1 <- summary(bin1)
binsum1
```


## Functions of measures

There're functions __bin_mean()__, __bin_variance()__, __bin_mode()__, __bin_skewness()__ and __bin_kurtosis()__, which all take two arguments: _trials_ and _prob_, calculating the corresponding measures of binomial distribution.

```{r}
bin_mean(10, 0.3)
```

```{r}
bin_variance(10, 0.3)
```

```{r}
bin_mode(10, 0.3)
```

```{r}
bin_skewness(10, 0.3)
```

```{r}
bin_kurtosis(10, 0.3)
```
