## Overview

`"binomial"` is a package that provides functions to do some relative calculations of binomial random variable.

* `bin_choose()` takes two arguments: __k__ and __n__, to calculate the number of
combinations in which _k_ successes can occur in _n_ trials.

* `bin_probability()` takes three arguments: __success__ (can be a vector), __trials__, and __prob__ to calculate the probability of binomial distribution.

* `bin_distribution()` takes two arguments: __trials__, and __prob__ and returns a data.frame with two classes: __c("bindis", "data.frame")__, _sucesses_ in the first column, _probability_ in the second column.
* `plot()` method for a `"bindis"` object.

* `bin_cumulative()` takes two arguments: __trials__, and __prob__ and returns a data.frame with two classes: __c("bindcum", "data.frame")__, _sucesses_ in the first column, _probability_ in the second column and __cumulative__ in the third column.
* `plot()` method for a `"bincum"` object.

* `bin_variable()` takes two arguments: __trials__, and __prob__ and returns an object of class `"binvar"`.
* `print()` method for a `"binvar"` object.
* `summary()` method for a `"binvar"` object.
* `print.summary()` method for a `"binvar"` object.

* `bin_mean()`, `bin_variance()`, `bin_mode()`, `bin_skewness()`, `bin_kurtosis()` all take in two arguments: trials and prob and return the corresponding measures of mean, variance, mode, skewness, kuttosis of the binomial random variable.


## Motivation

This package has been developed to do some calculations of binomial random variable and define some special print, plot, and summary methods.


## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub via the package `"devtools"`:

```r
# development version from GitHub:
#install.packages("devtools") 
# install "binomial" (without vignettes)
devtools::install_github("Agatemei/binomial")
# install "binomial" (with vignettes)
devtools::install_github("Agatemei/binomial", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```


## Usage

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(binomial)

# bin_choose()
bin_choose(n = 5, k = 2)
bin_choose(5, 0) 
bin_choose(5, 1:3)


# bin_probability()

# probability of getting 2 successes in 5 trials
# (assuming prob of success = 0.5)
bin_probability(success = 2, trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
# probabilities of getting 2 or less successes in 5 trials 
# (assuming prob of success = 0.5)
bin_probability(success = 0:2, trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
# 55 heads in 100 tosses of a loaded coin with 45% chance of heads
bin_probability(success = 55, trials = 100, prob = 0.45)


# bin_distribution()

# binomial probability distribution
bin_distribution(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
# plotting binomial probability distribution
dis1 <- bin_distribution(trials = 5, prob = 0.5) 
plot(dis1)
# binomial cumulative distribution
bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
# plotting binomial cumulative distribution
dis2 <- bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
plot(dis2)


# bin_variable()

bin1 <- bin_variable(trials = 10, p = 0.3) 
bin1

binsum1 <- summary(bin1)
binsum1


# functions of measures

bin_mean(10, 0.3)
bin_variance(10, 0.3)
bin_mode(10, 0.3)
bin_skewness(10, 0.3)
bin_kurtosis(10, 0.3)
```
